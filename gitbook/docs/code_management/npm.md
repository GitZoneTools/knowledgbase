# Npm
npm is short for "node package manager" and by now has grown to be the largest software registry of the world.
npm is one of the most useful tools you'll come accross as it makes creation, consumption, sharing and maintance of modules super easy and convenient.

Npm also has a client tool called npm which ships with node by default.
