## How to install
### nvm (Node Version Manager)

To install NodeJS in a required version the easiest way is the node version manager.

**Install nvm:**  
To install nvm use curl:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.1/install.sh | bash
# Installs nvm
# For latest version of nvm please see the official repo at:
# https://github.com/creationix/nvm
```
Then install a node version like this:

```sh
nvm install v4.2.4
nvm alias default v4.2.4
# first line installs node in version
# second line makes v4.2.4 the default version when starting bash
```
